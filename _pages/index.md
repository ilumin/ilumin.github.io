I'm a Bangkok-based software engineer who enjoys problem solving.

I create clean, efficient software solutions. I enjoy getting into a good book, whether it's a fascinating historical account or a thought-provoking short novel.

Aside from the technical parts of software development, I'm fascinated by the process of transforming requirements and business activities into elegant solutions. I get a lot of satisfaction from examining problems, understanding their underlying causes, and then developing clear and effective software solutions.
