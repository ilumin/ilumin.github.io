I'm a Bangkok-based Software Engineer with a passion for problem-solving.

I craft clean and efficient software solution. I love driving into a good book, whether it's a captivating historical account or a thought-provoking short novel.

Beyond the technical aspects of software development, I'm fascinated by the art of turning requirements and business flows into elegant solutions. I find immense satisfaction in analyzing problems, understanding their core, and then crafting clear and effective software responses.
